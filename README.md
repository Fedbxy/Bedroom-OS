Hello! This repository is for my private Discord server bot. I created this bot because I was bored and don't have anything to do. I saw a video on youtube and I want to create one bot for fun and learning. Thank to [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) for the help. Some part of the code is written by [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/).


## Files

Like what I said, the bot source is mainly taken from the [discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide/) as well as the command handler source. You can learn them from there. And I used the JavaScript and [discord.js API](https://discord.js.org/) for the bot. You can use my bot files. I wouldn't mind and would love to see others using my files.

## How do I install?

You can use my file by downloading the Node.js and install npm but I have small experience on hosting on local computer so please make sure to find out more. However, I used the online IDE website called [Replit](https://replit.com/) to host my bot with [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/). Find out more for more information about hosting the bot with Replit and UptimeRobot.

> Thank [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) for a free online .md file editor.

The bot isn't completed yet and may subject to be changed.
